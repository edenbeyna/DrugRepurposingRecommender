{"name": "diethylpropion", "category": "drug", "content": "Amfepramone, also known as diethylpropion, is a stimulant drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and cathinone classes that is used as an appetite suppressant. It is used in the short-term management of obesity, along with dietary and lifestyle changes. Amfepramone has a similar chemical structure to the antidepressant and smoking cessation aid bupropion (previously called amfebutamone), which has also been developed as a weight-loss medicine when in a combination product with naltrexone.   == Pharmacology == Amfepramone itself lacks any affinity for the monoamine transporters and instead functions as a prodrug to ethcathinone. Ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) is a very weak dopaminergic and serotonergic, and is approximately 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 stronger on norepinephrine in comparison, respectively.   == Chemistry == Amfepramone can be synthesized from propiophenone by bromination, followed by reaction with diethylamine.   == Society and culture ==   === Names === Another medically utilized name is diethylpropion (British Approved Name (BAN) and Australian Approved Name (AAN)). Chemical names include: \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-keto-N,N-diethylphenethylamine, N,N-diethyl-\u03b2-ketoamphetamine and N,N-diethylcathinone. Brand names include: Anorex, Linea, Nobesine, Prefamone, Regenon, Tepanil and Tenuate.   === Legal status === Amfepramone is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. In the UK amfepramone is a class C drug  and as a medicine, it is a Schedule 3 Controlled Drug which requires safe custody. As of June 2022, the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends the withdrawal of marketing authorizations for amfepramone.   === Recreational use === The authors of several studies of amfepramone claim that the substance has a relatively low potential for causing addiction in users.   == References =="}
