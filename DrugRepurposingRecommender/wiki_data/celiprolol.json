{"name": "celiprolol", "category": "drug", "content": "Celiprolol is a medication in the class of beta blockers, used in the treatment of high blood pressure. It has a unique pharmacology: it is a selective \u03b21 receptor antagonist, but a \u03b22 receptor partial agonist.  It is also a weak \u03b12 receptor antagonist. It was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in 1982.   == Medical use == Celiprolol is believed to provide clinical benefit for people with vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome by promoting normal collagen synthesis in the blood vessels, and by shifting the pressure load away from the vessels most prone to dissection and rupture. In 2019, a new drug application (NDA) for celiprolol was denied by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), instead calling for an \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d trial to determine whether celiprolol reduced the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS.    == Brand names == Brand names include Cardem, Selectol, Celipres, Celipro, Celol, Cordiax, Dilanorm   == References ==   == External links == Selectol Summary of Product Characteristics (from the IPHA Medicines Compendium) Celiprolol data sheet for New Zealand"}
