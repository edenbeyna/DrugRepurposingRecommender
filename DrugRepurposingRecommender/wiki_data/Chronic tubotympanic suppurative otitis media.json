{"name": "Chronic tubotympanic suppurative otitis media", "category": "disease", "content": "This is a shortened version of the sixth chapter of the ICD-9: Diseases of the Nervous System and Sense Organs. It covers ICD codes 320 to 389. The full chapter can be found on pages 215 to 258 of Volume 1, which contains all (sub)categories of the ICD-9. Volume 2 is an alphabetical index of Volume 1. Both volumes can be downloaded for free from the website of the World Health Organization. In the ICD-9 system, a disease may have a cause listed in one chapter, and its manifestations listed in another. For example, Tuberculous meningitis is caused by a bacterial infection, and is therefore listed in Chapter 1, Infectious and parasitic diseases. However, as it results in a disorder of the nervous system, it is also listed in this chapter. An asterisk (*) means that a disease has an underlying cause which can be found elsewhere in the ICD. A code referring to such an underlying cause may be right next to the name, in parentheses, and marked with a dagger symbol of the Times New Roman font (\u2020).   == Inflammatory diseases of the
