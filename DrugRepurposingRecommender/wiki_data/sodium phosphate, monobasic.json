{"name": "sodium phosphate, monobasic", "category": "drug", "content": "Monosodium phosphate (MSP), also known as monobasic sodium phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate, is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula NaH2PO4. It is a sodium salt of phosphoric acid. It consists of sodium cations (Na+) and dihydrogen phosphate anions (H2PO\u22124). One of many sodium phosphates, it is a common industrial chemical. The salt exists in an anhydrous form, as well as monohydrate and dihydrate (NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O and NaH2PO4\u00b72H2O respectively).   == Production and reactions == The salt is obtained by partial neutralization of phosphoric acid. The pKa of monosodium phosphate is 6.8-7.2 (depending on the physicochemical characteristics during pKa determination).  Heating this salt above 169 \u00b0C gives disodium pyrophosphate:  2 NaH2PO4 \u2192 Na2H2P2O7 + H2O When heated at 550 \u00b0C, anhydrous trisodium trimetaphosphate is formed:   3 NaH2PO4 \u2192 Na3P3O9 + 3 H2O   == Uses == Phosphates are often used in foods and in water treatment. The pH of such formulations is generally adjusted by mixtures of various sodium phosphates, such as this salt. The sodium chloride equivalent value, or E-Value, is 0.49. It is soluble in 4.5 parts water.   === Food additive === It is added in animal feed, toothpaste, and evaporated milk. It is used as a thickening agent and emulsifier.   === Detection of magnesium === Monosodium phosphate is used to detect the presence of magnesium ions in salts. Formation of a white precipitate on the addition of ammonium chloride, ammonium hydroxide and monosodium phosphate to an aqueous or dilute HCl solution of the salt indicates presence of magnesium ions.   == Notes =="}
