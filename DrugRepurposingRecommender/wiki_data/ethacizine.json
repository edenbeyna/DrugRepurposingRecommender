{"name": "ethacizine", "category": "drug", "content": "Ethacizine (ethacyzine) is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent, related to moracizine. It is used in Russia and some other CIS countries for the treatment of severe and/or refractory ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, especially those accompanied by organic heart disease. It is also indicated as a treatment of refractory tachycardia associated with Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome. It is manufactured under the brand name Ethacizin (\u042d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043d) by Latvian pharmaceutical company Olainfarm.   == Synthesis == For the treatment of heart infarction:  The amide formation between Phenothiazine-2-ethylcarbamate [37711-29-8] (1) and 3-Chloropropionyl chloride [625-36-5] (2) gives ethyl N-[10-(3-chloropropanoyl)phenothiazin-2-yl]carbamate [119407-03-3] [34749-22-9] (3). Displacement of the remaining \u03c9-halogen by diethylamine (4) then completes the synthesis of ethacizine (5).   == References =="}
