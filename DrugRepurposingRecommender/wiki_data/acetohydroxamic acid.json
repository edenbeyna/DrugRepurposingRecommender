{"name": "acetohydroxamic acid", "category": "drug", "content": "Acetohydroxamic acid (also known as AHA or by the trade name Lithostat) is a drug that is a potent and irreversible enzyme inhibitor of the urease enzyme in various bacteria and plants; it is usually used for urinary tract infections. The molecule is similar to urea but is not hydrolyzable by urease; it thus disrupts the bacteria's metabolism through competitive inhibition.   == Orphan drug == In 1983 the US Food and Drug Administration approved acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) as an orphan drug for \"prevention of so-called struvite stones\" under the newly enacted Orphan Drug Act of 1983. AHA cannot be patented because it is a standard chemical compound.   == See also == Salicylhydroxamic acid   == References =="}
