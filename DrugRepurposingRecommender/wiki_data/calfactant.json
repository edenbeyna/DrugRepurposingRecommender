It is used in premature infants with lung surfactant deficiency that causes infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS).   == Mechanism of action == Lung surfactant is essential for effective ventilation as it modifies alveolar surface tension. IRDS is caused by a lung surfactant deficiency. Calfactant serves as a substitute for the natural surfactant.   == References =="}
