{"name": "eltanolone", "category": "drug", "content": "Pregnanolone, also known as eltanolone, is an endogenous inhibitory neurosteroid which is produced in the body from progesterone. It is closely related to allopregnanolone, which has similar properties.   == Biological activity == Pregnanolone is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, as well as a negative allosteric modulator of the glycine receptor.   == Biological function == Pregnanolone has sedative, anxiolytic, anesthetic, and anticonvulsant effects. During pregnancy, pregnanolone and allopregnanolone are involved in sedation and anesthesia of the fetus.   == Biochemistry == Pregnanolone is synthesized from progesterone via the enzymes 5\u03b2-reductase and 3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, with 5\u03b2-dihydroprogesterone occurring as a metabolic intermediate. The elimination half-life of pregnanolone is between 0.9 and 3.5 hours.   == Chemistry ==  Pregnanolone, also known as 3\u03b1,5\u03b2-tetrahydroprogesterone (3\u03b1,5\u03b2-THP) or as 5\u03b2-pregnan-3\u03b1-ol-20-one, is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. Related compounds include allopregnanolone (3\u03b1,5\u03b1-THP; brexanolone), epipregnanolone (3\u03b2,5\u03b2-THP), hydroxydione, isopregnanolone (3\u03b2,5\u03b1-THP), and renanolone.   == History == Pregnanolone was first isolated from the urine of pregnant women in 1937. Its anesthetic properties were first demonstrated in animals in 1957.   == Research == Pregnanolone was investigated for clinical use as a general anesthetic under the name eltanolone (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name), but produced unwanted side effects such as convulsions on occasion, and for this reason, was never marketed.   == References =="}
