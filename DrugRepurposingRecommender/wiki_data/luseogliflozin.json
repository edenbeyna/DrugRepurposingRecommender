It was approved for use in Japan in 2014. In a meta-analysis involving data from 10 randomized controlled trials (1304 patients), Dutta et. al. demonstrated the good glycaemic efficacy (mean glycated hemoglobin reduction of -0.76% and mean fasting glucose reduction of -26.69mg/dl) and safety of luseogliflozin 2.5mg/day as compared to placebo. Additional benefits include significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-4.19 mm Hg), serum triglycerides (-12.60mg/dl), uric acid (-0.48mg/dl) and alanine aminotransferase (-4.11 IU/L) as compared to placebo, highlighting the beneficial impact on the different aspects of metabolic syndrome.    == References =="}
