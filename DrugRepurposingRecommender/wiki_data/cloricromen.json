{"name": "cloricromen", "category": "drug", "content": "Cloricromen is a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Coronary vasodilator.   == Synthesis ==  Base catalyzed alkylation of ethyl acetoacetate (1) with 2-chlorotriethylamine (2) gives compound (3). Separately, disulfonation of resorcinol (4) with 96% sulfuric acid gives the disulfonic acid (5). This is chlorinated with potassium chlorate to give 5-chloro-4,6-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (6). Removal of the sulfonate groups in dilute acid then gives 2-chlororesorcinol (7). An acid-catalyzed condensation reaction between (3) and (7) produces the intermediate (8). Ether formation at its phenolic hydroxyl group with ethyl bromoacetate (9) completes the synthesis of cloricromen.   == See also == Carbocromen is the analogue without the chlorine substituent   == References =="}
