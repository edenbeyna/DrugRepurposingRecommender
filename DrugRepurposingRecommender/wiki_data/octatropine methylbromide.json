{"name": "octatropine methylbromide", "category": "drug", "content": "Octatropine methylbromide (INN) or anisotropine methylbromide (USAN), trade names Valpin, Endovalpin, Lytispasm and others, is a muscarinic antagonist and antispasmodic. It was introduced to the U.S. market in 1963 as an adjunct in the treatment of peptic ulcer, and promoted as being more specific to the gastrointestinal tract than other anticholinergics, although its selectivity was questioned in later studies. Octatropine has been superseded by more effective agents in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, and is no longer used. It is still sold in some countries in combination with other drugs, such as phenobarbital and metamizole.   == References =="}
