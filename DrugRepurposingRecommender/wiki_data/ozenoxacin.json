{"name": "ozenoxacin", "category": "drug", "content": "Ozenoxacin, sold under the brand names Ozanex and Xepi, is a quinolone antibiotic used for the treatment of impetigo.  A 1% topical cream is approved for treatment of impetigo in Canada and in the United States. Ozenoxacin is active against some bacteria that have developed resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.   == Mechanism of action == Like other quinolone antibiotics, ozenoxacin targets DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  Its activity against bacteria with fluoroquinolone resistance is attributed to its evasion of bacterial efflux pumps.   == Chemistry ==   === Synthesis === Ozenoxacin is synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of a bromoquinolone and a pyridyl tributylstannane (Stille coupling).  The pyridyl tributylstannane is synthesized from the corresponding dihalopyridine. This is achieved through a sequence of nucleophilic aromatic substitution with methylamine, which is protected as the acetamide using acetic anhydride and this is converted to the organostannane through a Pd-catalyzed stannylation with bis(tributyltin). The bromoquinolone is made from the N-cyclopropyl aniline and diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate, which react through a Michael addition, followed by elimination of the ethoxy group and then a Friedel-Crafts acylation at elevated temperature. The N-cyclopropyl aniline is prepared by a Pd-catalyzed cross coupling of 2,6-dibromotoluene and cyclopropylamine (Buchwald-Hartwig coupling).   == References =="}
