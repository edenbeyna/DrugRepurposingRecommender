{"name": "colestipol", "category": "drug", "content": "Colestipol (trade names Colestid, Cholestabyl) is a bile acid sequestrant used to lower blood cholesterol, specifically low-density lipoprotein (LDL).  It is also used to reduce stool volume and frequency, and in the treatment of chronic diarrhea. Like cholestyramine, colestipol works in the gut by trapping bile acids and preventing them from being reabsorbed. This leads to decreased enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids, increased synthesis of new bile acids by the liver from cholesterol, decreased liver cholesterol, increased LDL receptor expression, and decreasing LDL in blood.   == Side effects == The following notable side effects may occur:  gastrointestinal tract disturbances, especially (mild, occasionally severe) constipation sometimes increase in VLDL and triglyceride synthesis   == Interactions == Colestipol can bind to a number of drugs and nutrients in the gut and inhibit or delay their absorption. Such substances include:  thiazide diuretics, furosemide gemfibrozil benzylpenicillin, tetracycline digoxin lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)   == Contraindications == Colestipol is contraindicated in hypertriglyceridemia (high level of triglycerides in the blood).   == Chemistry == Colestipol is a copolymer of diethylenetriamine (DETA) \u2014or tetraethylenepentamine according to some sources\u2014 and epichlorohydrin. The structure drawing (top right) shows the DETA moieties in blue and the epichlorohydrin moieties in red.   == Notes and references =="}
