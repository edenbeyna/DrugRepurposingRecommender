{"name": "hematoporphyrin", "category": "drug", "content": "Hematoporphyrin (Photodyn, Sensibion) is a porphyrin prepared from hemin.  It is a derivative of protoporphyrin IX, where the two vinyl groups have been hydrated (converted to alcohols). It is a deeply colored solid that is usually encountered as a solution.  Its chemical structure was determined in 1900. It is used as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy.  Acetylation of hematoporphyrin followed by hydrolysis of the product of that reaction affords a mixture called hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD), which is also used in photodynamic therapy. Hematoporphyrin has also been used as an antidepressant and antipsychotic since the 1920s.   == References =="}
