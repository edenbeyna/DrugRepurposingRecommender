{"name": "oxeladin", "category": "drug", "content": "Oxeladin is a cough suppressant. It is a highly potent and effective drug used to treat all types of cough of various etiologies.  It is not related to opium or its derivatives, so treatment with oxeladin is free of risk of dependence or addiction. Oxeladin has none of the side effects (such as hypnosis, respiratory depression, tolerance, constipation and analgesia) which are present when common antitussives, such as codeine and its derivatives, are used.
