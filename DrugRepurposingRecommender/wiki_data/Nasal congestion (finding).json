{"name": "Nasal congestion (finding)", "category": "disease", "content": "Oxymetazoline, sold under the brand name Afrin among others, is a topical decongestant and vasoconstrictor medication. It is available over-the-counter as a nasal spray to treat nasal congestion and nosebleeds, as eye drops to treat eye redness due to minor irritation, and (in the United States) as a prescription topical cream to treat persistent facial redness due to rosacea in adults. Its effects begin within minutes and last for up to six hours. Intranasal use for longer than three days may cause congestion to recur or worsen, resulting in physical dependence. Oxymetazoline is a derivative of imidazole. It was developed from xylometazoline at Merck by Wolfgang Fruhstorfer and Helmut M\u00fcller-Calgan in 1961. A direct sympathomimetic, oxymetazoline binds to and activates \u03b11 adrenergic receptors and \u03b12 adrenergic receptors, most notably. One study classified it in the following order: \u03b1(2A) > \u03b1(1A) \u2265 \u03b1(2B) > \u03b1(1D) \u2265 \u03b1(2C) >> \u03b1(1B), but this is not universally agreed upon. Another study classified it with selectivity ratios in alpha 2 adrenergic receptors of 200 for a2A vs a2B, 7.1 a2A vs a2C, and 28.2 a2B vs a2C. In 2021, it was the 292nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions.   == Medical uses == Oxymetazoline is available over-the-counter as a topical decongestant in the form of oxymetazoline hydrochloride in nasal sprays. In the United States, oxymetazoline 1% cream is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for topical treatment of persistent facial erythema (redness) associated with rosacea in adults. Due to its vasoconstricting properties, oxymetazoline is also used to treat nose bleeds and eye redness due to minor irritation (marketed as Visine L.R. in the form of eye drops). In July 2020, oxymetazoline received approval by the FDA for the treatment of acquired drooping eyelid.   == Side effects ==   === Rebound congestion === Rebound congestion, or rhinitis medicamentosa, may occur. A 2006 review of the pathology of rhinitis medicamentosa concluded that use of oxymetazoline for more than three days may result in rhinitis medicamentosa and recommended limiting use to three days.   ==== Australian regulatory submission ==== Novartis recommended a five day maximum usage period, rather than three days, in a submission to the Therapeutic Goods Administration.  Novartis suggested that \"The justification [for 3 days] was not based on evidence\" and cited an extensive body of evidence, and noting a range of recommended periods from five to ten days,  which coincides with the typical duration of the common cold.   == Overdose == There is no specific antidote for oxymetazoline, although its pharmacological effects may be reversed by an adrenergic antagonists such as phentolamine.   == Pharmacology ==   === Pharmacodynamics === Oxymetazoline is a sympathomimetic that selectively agonizes \u03b11 and, partially, \u03b12 adrenergic receptors. Since vascular beds widely express \u03b11 receptors, the action of oxymetazoline results in vasoconstriction. In addition, the local application of the drug also results in vasoconstriction due to its action on endothelial postsynaptic \u03b12 receptors; systemic application of \u03b12 agonists, in contrast, causes vasodilation because of centrally-mediated inhibition of sympathetic tone via presynaptic \u03b12 receptors. Vasoconstriction of vessels results in relief of nasal congestion in two ways: first, it increases the diameter of the airway lumen; second, it reduces fluid exudation from postcapillary venules. It can reduce nasal airway resistance (NAR) up to 35.7% and reduce nasal mucosal blood flow up to 50%.   === Pharmacokinetics === Since imidazolines are sympathomimetic agents, their primary effects appear on \u03b1 adrenergic receptors, with little if any effect on \u03b2 adrenergic receptors. Like other imidazolines, Oxymetazoline is readily absorbed orally. Effects on \u03b1 receptors from systemically absorbed oxymetazoline hydrochloride may persist for up to 7 hours after a single dose. The elimination half-life in humans is 5\u20138 hours. It is excreted unchanged both by the kidneys (30%) and in feces (10%).   == History == The oxymetazoline brand Afrin was first sold as a prescription medication in 1966. After finding substantial early success as a prescription medication, it became available as an over-the-counter drug in 1975. Schering-Plough did not engage in heavy advertising until 1986.   == Society and culture ==   === Brand names === Brand names include Afrin, ClariClear, Dristan, Drixine, Drixoral, Nasivin, Nasivion, Nezeril, Nostrilla, Logicin, Vicks Sinex, Visine L.R., Sudafed OM, Otrivin, Oxy, SinuFrin, Upneeq, and Mucinex Sinus-Max.   == References =="}
