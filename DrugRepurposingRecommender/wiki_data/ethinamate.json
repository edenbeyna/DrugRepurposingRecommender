{"name": "ethinamate", "category": "drug", "content": "Ethinamate (Valamin, Valmid) is a short-acting carbamate-derivative sedative-hypnotic medication used to treat insomnia.  Regular use leads to drug tolerance, and it is usually not effective for more than 7 days.  Prolonged use can lead to dependence. Ethinamate has been replaced by other medicines (particularly benzodiazepines), and it is not available in the Netherlands, the United States or Canada. It is a schedule IV substance in the United States.   == Synthesis == Ethinamate (1-ethynylcyclohexanone carbamate) is synthesized by combining acetylene with cyclohexanone to make 1-ethynylcyclohexanol, and then transforming this into a carbamate by the subsequent reaction with phosgene, and later with ammonia. Some lithium metal or similar is used to make the acetylene react with the cyclohexanone in the first step.   == References =="}
