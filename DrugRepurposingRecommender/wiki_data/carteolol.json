{"name": "carteolol", "category": "drug", "content": "Carteolol is a non-selective beta blocker used to treat glaucoma. It is administered in the form of eye drops. Carteolol was patented in 1972 and approved for medical use in 1980.   == Pharmacology ==   === Pharmacodynamics === Carteolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. It is selective for the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor and has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Carteolol has also been found to act as a serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist in addition to being a beta blocker.   === Pharmacokinetics === Carteolol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects.   == Society and culture ==   === Brand names === Brand names of carteolol include Arteolol, Arteoptic, Calte, Cart\u00e9abak, Carteol, Cart\u00e9ol, Cartrol, Elebloc, Endak, Glauteolol, Mikelan, Ocupress, Poenglaucol, Singlauc, and Teoptic.   == References ==   == Further reading =="}
