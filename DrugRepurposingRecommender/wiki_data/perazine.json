{"name": "perazine", "category": "drug", "content": "Perazine (Taxilan) is a moderate-potency typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class. It is quite similar to chlorpromazine, and acts as a dopamine antagonist. It was very popular in West-Germany. A 2014 systematic review compared it with other antipsychotic drugs:     == Synthesis ==  Phenothiazine-10-propionitrile [1698-80-2] (1) is treated with a mixture of acid and alcohol giving Methyl phenothiazinepropionate, CID:368244 (2). Heating with 1-methylpiperazine (3) gives the amide [91508-47-3] (4). Reduction of this last by means of diborane yields Perazine (5).   == See also == Carphenazine Dixyrazine Methdilazine Pipamazine   == References ==   == External links == Perazine at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)"}
