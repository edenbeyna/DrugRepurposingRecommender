Too much absorption can lead to unwanted side effects elsewhere in the body. Large amounts of desoximetasone should be avoided over large areas. It should not be used for extended periods of time. Treated areas should not be covered with airtight dressings such as plastic wrap or adhesive bandages. Children may absorb more medication than adults do.
