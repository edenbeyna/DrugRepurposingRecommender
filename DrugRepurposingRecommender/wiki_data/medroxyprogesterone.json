{"name": "medroxyprogesterone", "category": "drug", "content": "Medroxyprogesterone (MP), is a progestin which is not used medically. A derivative, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), is used as a medication in humans, and is far more widely known in comparison. Medroxyprogesterone is sometimes used as a synonym for medroxyprogesterone acetate, and what is almost always being referred to when the term is used is MPA and not medroxyprogesterone.   == Pharmacology ==   === Pharmacodynamics === Compared to MPA, medroxyprogesterone is over two orders of magnitude less potent as a progestogen. Medroxyprogesterone is also notable in that it is a minor metabolite of MPA. In addition to its progestagenic activity, medroxyprogesterone is a weak antiandrogen in vitro on human androgen receptor.   == Chemistry ==  Medroxyprogesterone, also known as 6\u03b1-methyl-17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone or as 6\u03b1-methyl-17\u03b1-hydroxypregn-4-en-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone with a methyl group at the C6\u03b1 position. The generic name of medroxyprogesterone is a contraction of 6\u03b1-methyl-17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone. It is closely related to medrogestone as well as other unesterified 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone, cyproterone, and megestrol.   == Society and culture ==   === Generic names === Medroxyprogesterone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name.  Brand Name Meprate 10 Tablets (practo)   == References =="}
