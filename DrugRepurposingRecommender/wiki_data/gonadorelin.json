It is also used in veterinary medicine. The medication is a form of the endogenous GnRH and is identical to it in chemical structure. It is given by injection into a blood vessel or fat or as a nasal spray.   == Medical uses == Gonadorelin is used as a diagnostic agent to assess pituitary gland function. It is also used in the treatment of primary hypothalamic amenorrhea, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (e.g., Kallmann syndrome), delayed puberty, cryptorchidism, and infertility.
