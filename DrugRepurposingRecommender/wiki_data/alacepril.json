{"name": "alacepril", "category": "drug", "content": "Alacepril (INN) is an ACE inhibitor medication indicated as a treatment for hypertension. The medication metabolizes to captopril and desacetylalacepril. Alacepril is primarily used to treat hypertension, and in some cases, renovascular hypertension. It's often combined with other medications, particularly other blood pressure lowering classes of medications like thiazide diuretics to maximize its effectiveness.   == Mechanism of action == In vivo, when alacepril undergoes deacetylation, it loses a molecule similar to the amino acid phenylalanine which transforms it into captopril. Captopril then provides its blood pressure lowering effect through two ways. First, it inhibits the conversion of angiotensin 1, a precursor molecule, to angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor that narrows blood vessels. Secondly, captopril prevents the breakdown of bradykinin, a vasodilator peptide that naturally relaxes blood vessels.   == Synthesis ==  Amide formation between S-Acetylcaptopril [64838-55-7] (1) and (S)-tert-Butyl 2-amino-3-phenylpropanoate [16874-17-2] (2) gives PC86595505 (3). Deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid completed the synthesis of alacepril (4).   == References ==   == External links ==  Media related to Alacepril at Wikimedia Commons"}
