With respect to potency, it is regarded as a Class I corticosteroid [of classes I \u2013 VII] in the United States. No long-term animal studies have been done to determine whether diflorasone diacetate could have carcinogenic properties. Little data is available regarding whether diflorasone diacetate would be present in great enough quantities to cause harm to an infant.   == References ==   == External links == \"Diflorasone diacetate\".
