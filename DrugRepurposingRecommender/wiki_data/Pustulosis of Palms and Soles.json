{"name": "Pustulosis of Palms and Soles", "category": "disease", "content": "Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris  is a chronic recurrent pustular dermatosis (that is, a pustulosis or pustular psoriasis) localized on the palms and soles only, characterized histologically by intraepidermal pustules filled with neutrophils.:\u200a411,\u200a628\u200a:\u200a204\u200a It can occur as part of the SAPHO syndrome.   == Treatment == Systematic reviews show evidence to support the use of systemic retinoids alone and in combination with photochemotherapy to improve symptoms of chronic palmoplantar pustulosis, with a combination more effective than one alone. There is also evidence to support topical steroids under hydrocolloid occlusion dressings, low dose ciclosporin, tetracyclines, and Grenz-Ray Therapy. There is no evidence to support the use of hydroxyurea in chronic palmoplantar pustulosis. Treatment with guselkumab, an anti\u2013interleukin 23 monoclonal antibody has shown a decrease in the size of the area affected and severity.   == See also == List of cutaneous conditions   == References ==   == External links =="}
