{"name": "calcium levulinate", "category": "drug", "content": "ATC code A12 Mineral supplements is a therapeutic subgroup of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, a system of alphanumeric codes developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the classification of drugs and other medical products. Subgroup A12 is part of the anatomical group A Alimentary tract and metabolism. Codes for veterinary use (ATCvet codes) can be created by placing the letter Q in front of the human ATC code: for example, QA12. ATCvet codes without corresponding human ATC codes are cited with the leading Q in the following list.National issues of the ATC classification may include additional codes not present in this list, which follows the WHO version.   == A12A Calcium ==   === A12AA Calcium ===  A12AA01 Calcium phosphate A12AA02 Calcium glubionate A12AA03 Calcium gluconate A12AA04 Calcium carbonate A12AA05 Calcium lactate A12AA06 Calcium lactate gluconate A12AA07 Calcium chloride A12AA08 Calcium glycerylphosphate A12AA09 Calcium citrate lysine complex A12AA10 Calcium glucoheptonate A12AA11 Calcium pangamate A12AA13 Calcium citrate A12AA20 Calcium (different salts in combination) A12AA30 Calcium laevulate   === A12AX Calcium, combinations with vitamin D and/or other drugs ===   == A12B Potassium ==   === A12BA Potassium === A12BA01 Potassium chloride (medical use) A12BA02 Potassium citrate A12BA03 Potassium hydrogentartrate A12BA04 Potassium hydrogencarbonate A12BA05 Potassium gluconate A12BA30 Potassium (different salts in combination) A12BA51 Potassium chloride, combinations   == A12C Other mineral supplements ==   === A12CA Sodium === A12CA01 Sodium chloride or saline (medicine) A12CA02 Sodium sulfate   === A12CB Zinc === A12CB01 Zinc sulfate A12CB02 Zinc gluconate A12CB03 Zinc protein complex   === A12CC Magnesium ===  A12CC01 Magnesium chloride A12CC02 Magnesium sulfate (medical use) A12CC03 Magnesium gluconate A12CC04 Magnesium citrate A12CC05 Magnesium aspartate A12CC06 Magnesium lactate A12CC07 Magnesium levulinate A12CC08 Magnesium pidolate A12CC09 Magnesium orotate A12CC10 Magnesium oxide A12CC30 Magnesium (different salts in combination)   === A12CD Fluoride === A12CD01 Sodium fluoride A12CD02 Sodium monofluorophosphate A12CD51 Fluoride, combinations   === A12CE Selenium === A12CE01 Sodium selenate A12CE02 Sodium selenite QA12CE99 Selenium, combinations   === A12CX Other mineral products === QA12CX90 Toldimfos QA12CX91 Butafosfan QA12CX99 Other mineral products, combinations   == References =="}
