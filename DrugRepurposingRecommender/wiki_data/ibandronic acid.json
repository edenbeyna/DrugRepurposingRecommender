{"name": "ibandronic acid", "category": "drug", "content": "Ibandronic acid is a bisphosphonate medication used in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and metastasis-associated skeletal fractures in people with cancer. It may also be used to treat hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels).  It is typically formulated as its sodium salt ibandronate sodium. It was patented in 1986 by Boehringer Mannheim and approved for medical use in 1996.   == Medical uses == Ibandronate is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. In May 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ibandronate as a daily treatment for post-menopausal osteoporosis. The basis for this approval was a three-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial women with post-menopausal osteoporosis. Each participant also received daily oral doses of calcium and 400IUs [international units] of vitamin D. At the study's conclusion, both doses significantly reduced the occurrence risk of new vertebral fractures by 50\u201352 percent when compared to the effects of the placebo drug. Ibandronate is efficacious for the prevention of metastasis-related bone fractures in multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and certain other cancers.   == Adverse effects == In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a communication warning of the possibility of severe and sometimes incapacitating bone, joint or muscle pain. A study conducted by the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research concluded that long-term use of bisphosphonates, including Boniva, may increase the risk of a rare but serious fracture of the femur. The drug also has been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw, relatively rare but serious condition.   == Pharmacology ==   == Society and culture ==   === Brand names ===  Ibandronic acid is sold under the brand names Boniva, Bondronat, Bonviva, Bandrone, Ibandrix, Adronil, Bondrova, Bonprove, and Fosfonat.   == References =="}
