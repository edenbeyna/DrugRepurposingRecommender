{"name": "acetohexamide", "category": "drug", "content": "Acetohexamide (trade name Dymelor) is a first-generation sulfonylurea medication used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in people whose diabetes cannot be controlled by diet alone.   == Mechanism of action == Acetohexamide binds to an ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells. This inhibits the outflux of potassium, which causes the membrane potential to become more positive. This depolarization in turn opens voltage-gated calcium channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of insulin.   == Risks == Sulfonylureas, especially first-generation sulfonylureas such as Acetohexamide, can cause severe hypoglycemia and increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.    == References =="}
