{"name": "fentiazac", "category": "drug", "content": "Fentiazac is a thiazole-based nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) developed for use in joint and muscular pain. Like most other NSAIDs, it acts through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, via non-selective inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2. First described in 1974, it was synthesized using the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis. Fentiazac was marketed under the trade-name Norvedan (among others), but its market status is currently unknown and assumed to be discontinued.   == See also == Fenclozic acid   == References =="}
