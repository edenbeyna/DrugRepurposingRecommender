It is specifically designed for the treatment of acne, and was approved by the FDA in October 2018 for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older. Two randomized and well-controlled clinical trials reported efficacy data on both facial and truncal acne (back and chest). Efficacy was assessed in a total of 2002 subjects 9 years of age and older.
