{"name": "inositol nicotinate", "category": "drug", "content": "Inositol nicotinate, also known as inositol hexanicotinate or inositol hexaniacinate, is a compound of niacin (vitamin B3) and inositol. It is marketed in the United States as a \"no-flush\" form of niacin in dietary supplements.   == Mechanism of action == When ingested, inositol nicotinate breaks down into inositol and niacin. The niacin component helps widen blood vessels (vasodilation), lowers blood lipid levels (including cholesterol), and inhibits a protein involved in blood clotting.   == Uses == Inositol nicotinate is used to treat blood circulation problems, including:  Raynaud's phenomenon Intermittent claudication Some research shows it can improve symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon over several weeks. However, its effectiveness in treating other conditions like:  High cholesterol High blood pressure Leg pain during exercise (due to poor circulation) remains unclear, with studies producing mixed results. Other proposed uses, such as for:  Migraines Psoriasis Restless legs syndrome have insufficient supporting evidence.   == Side effects == Inositol nicotinate is generally safe when taken by mouth, but possible side effects include:  Stomach upset Intestinal gas Nausea Liver damage (similar to other niacin products) It is marketed as \"no-flush\" niacin, but research suggests that the lack of flushing may be due to its limited conversion to active niacin.   == Precautions == Inositol nicotinate should be used with caution in individuals with certain conditions:  Diabetes: May raise blood sugar levels. Diabetic patients should monitor their blood sugar levels closely. Liver disease or kidney disease: Niacin can accumulate in people with liver or kidney problems, potentially worsening their condition. Bleeding disorders: Inositol nicotinate may slow blood clotting, increasing the risk of bleeding for individuals with clotting disorders or those undergoing surgery. Gout: Large amounts of niacin may trigger gout attacks.   == References =="}
