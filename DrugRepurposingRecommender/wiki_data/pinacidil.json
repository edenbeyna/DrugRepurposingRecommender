{"name": "pinacidil", "category": "drug", "content": "Pinacidil is a cyanoguanidine drug that opens ATP-sensitive potassium channels producing peripheral vasodilatation of arterioles. It reduces blood pressure and peripheral resistance and produces fluid retention.   == Synthesis ==  Condensation of 4-isothiocyanotopyridine [76105-84-5] (1) and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanamine [3850-30-4] (2) gives thiourea [67027-06-9] (3). Treatment of that intermediate with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, carbon tetrachloride, and triethylamine leads to the unsymmetrical carbodiimide, CID:20501933 (4'). Addition of cyanamid affords pinacidil (5).   == References ==   == External links == Pinacidil at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)"}
