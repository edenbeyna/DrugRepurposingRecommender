{"name": "Mucocutaneous candidiasis", "category": "disease", "content": "Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is an immune disorder of T cells. It is characterized by chronic infections with Candida that are limited to mucosal surfaces, skin, and nails.:\u200a310\u200a It can also be associated with other types of infections, such as human papilloma virus. An association with chromosome 2 has been identified.   == Types ==   == Signs and symptoms == The signs and symptoms of this condition are thickened skin, skin ulcer, dyspareunia, endocardium abnormality, vision problems, hepatitis, seizures, bloody urine, and meningitis.   === Associated diseases or conditions === There are a number of disorders associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis including endocrine dysfunctions, vitiligo, malabsorption syndromes, neoplasms, and others. In most patients, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is correlated to abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity (T-lymphocyte mediated response). The T-lymphocytes fail to produce the necessary cytokines that are required for immunity against Candida. Current effective treatments include anti-fungal drugs and, for long-term remissions, restoration of cellular immunity. Patients with autosomal-dominant mucocutaneous candidiasis may be at risk for epidermoid esophageal cancer due to the nitrosamine compounds produced by chronic candida infections.   == Cause == Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis can be inherited either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. There are 9 types of this condition with the first CANDF1 being located at 2p22.3-p21 (cytogenetically).   == Mechanism == The mechanism the human immune system has is normally to fight an infection (like Candida). Initially, Th17 cells are made by the immune system, which in turn produces interleukin-17 (IL-17). This induces inflammation and white blood cells confront infection. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis mutations affect IL-17 by inhibiting its pathway. This in turn affects the human immune system's ability to fight infection, in total there are 9 possible types of this condition.  \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t   == Diagnosis == Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis can be diagnosed in an affected individual via the following methods/tests:   == Treatment ==  Management for an individual with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis consists of the following (relapse occurs once treatment is ceased, in many cases):  Systemic anti-fungal therapy (e.g., Fluconazole) Transfer factor Combination therapy Screening (annually)   == See also == Candidiasis List of cutaneous conditions   == Notes == ^  Indicates 9 references to specific, numbered pages in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database.   == References ==   == Further reading == Kauffman, Carol A.; Pappas, Peter G.; Sobel, Jack D.; Dismukes, William E.
