{"name": "guanabenz", "category": "drug", "content": "Guanabenz (pronounced GWAHN-a-benz, sold under the trade name Wytensin) is an alpha agonist that is selective to the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor. Guanabenz is used as an antihypertensive drug used in the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension). The most common side effects during guanabenz therapy are dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache and weakness. Guanabenz can make one drowsy or less alert, therefore driving or operating dangerous machinery is not recommended.   == Research == Guanabenz also has some anti-inflammatory properties in different pathological situations, including multiple sclerosis. Guanabenz was found in one study to exert an inhibitory effect by decreasing the abundance of the enzyme CH25H, a cholesterol hydroxylase linked to antiviral immunity. Therefore, it is suggested that the drug and similar compounds could be used to treat type I interferon-dependent pathologies and that the CH25H enzyme could be a therapeutic target to control these diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.   == See also == Guanoxabenz Guanfacine   == References =="}
