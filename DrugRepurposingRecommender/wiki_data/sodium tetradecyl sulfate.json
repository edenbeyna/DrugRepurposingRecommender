It is commonly used in the treatment of varicose and spider veins of the leg, during the procedure of sclerotherapy. Being a detergent, its action is on the lipid molecules in the cells of the vein wall, causing inflammatory destruction of the internal lining of the vein and thrombus formation eventually leading to sclerosis of the vein. It is used in concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 3% for this purpose. It is occasionally used for the treatment of stabilisation of joints that regularly dislocate, particularly in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In the UK, Ireland, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, it is sold under the trade-name Fibro-Vein in concentrations of 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 3%.   == Synthesis == Tetradecyl alcohol is treated with sulfur trioxide followed by neutralization of the resulting pyrosulfuric acid with sodium hydroxide.   == References =="}
