{"name": "bemiparin", "category": "drug", "content": "Bemiparin (trade names Ivor and Zibor, among others) is an antithrombotic and belongs to the group of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH).   == Medical uses == Bemiparin is used for the prevention of thromboembolism after surgery, and to prevent blood clotting in the extracorporeal circuit in haemodialysis.   == Contraindications == The medication is contraindicated in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation; acute bleeding or risk of bleeding; injury or surgery of the central nervous system, eyes or ears; severe liver or pancreas impairment; and acute or subacute bacterial endocarditis.   == Interactions == No interaction studies have been conducted. Drugs that are expected to increase the risk of bleeding in combination with bemiparin include other anticoagulants, aspirin and other NSAIDs, antiplatelet drugs, and corticosteroids.   == Chemistry == Like semuloparin, bemiparin is classified as an ultra-LMWH because of its low molecular mass of 3600 g/mol on average. (Enoxaparin has 4500 g/mol.) These heparins have lower anti-thrombin activity than classical LMWHs and act mainly on factor Xa, reducing the risk of bleeding.   == References ==   == External links == bemiparin at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)"}
