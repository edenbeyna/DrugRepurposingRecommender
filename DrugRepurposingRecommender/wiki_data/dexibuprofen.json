{"name": "dexibuprofen", "category": "drug", "content": "Dexibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is the active dextrorotatory enantiomer of ibuprofen. Most ibuprofen formulations contain a racemic mixture of both isomers. Dexibuprofen is a chiral switch of racemic ibuprofen. The chiral carbon in dexibuprofen is assigned an absolute configuration of (S) per the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog rules. Dexibuprofen is also called as S(+)Ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is an \u03b1-arylpropionic acid used largely in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and widely used over-the counter drug for headache and minor pains. This drug has a chiral center and exists as a pair of enantiomers. (S)-Ibuprofen, the eutomer, is responsible for the desired therapeutic effect. The inactive (R)-enantiomer, the distomer, undergoes a unidirectional chiral inversion to give the active (S)-enantiomer, the former acting as a prodrug for the latter. That is, when the ibuprofen is administered as a racemate the distomer is converted in vivo into the eutomer while the latter is unaffected.   == See also == Chiral switch Enantiopure drug Chirality Eudysmic ratio Ibuprofen   == References =="}
