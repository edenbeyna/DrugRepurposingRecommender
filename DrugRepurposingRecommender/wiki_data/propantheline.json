{"name": "propantheline", "category": "drug", "content": "Propantheline bromide (INN) is an antimuscarinic agent used for the treatment of excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), cramps or spasms of the stomach, intestines (gut) or bladder, and involuntary urination (enuresis). It can also be used to control the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and similar conditions. This agent can also be used for patients who experience intense GI symptoms while tapering off of TCAs.    == Indications == By relaxing the gut muscle, propantheline can relieve pain in conditions caused by spasm of the muscle in the gut. Relaxing the smooth muscle in the bladder prevents the involuntary spasms that can allow leakage of urine from the bladder in the condition known as enuresis (involuntary urination in adults). Propantheline can also be used to treat excessive sweating because acetylcholine block also reduces secretions such as sweat and tears.   == Adverse effects == Side effects include tachycardia, constipation, hypersensitivity to light, dry mouth, and urinary retention. This can also be prescribed by dentists for certain patients who salivate excessively. By giving this medication it becomes easier to do \"dry\" dentistry.   == Mechanism of action == Propantheline is one of a group of antispasmodic medications which work by blocking the action of the chemical messenger acetylcholine, which is produced by nerve cells, to muscarinic receptors present in various smooth muscular tissues, in places such as the gut, bladder and eye. Normally, the binding of acetylcholine induces involuntary smooth muscular contractions.   == References =="}
