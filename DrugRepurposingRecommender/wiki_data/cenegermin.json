In July 2017, it was approved in the European Union as an eye drop formulation for the treatment of moderate or severe neurotrophic keratitis in adults. As a recombinant form of NGF, cenegermin is a peripherally selective agonist of the TrkA and LNGFR (p75NTR) which must be administered parenterally. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.   == History == It was developed by Anabasis Pharma, Domp\u00e9 Farmaceutici, and Ospedale San Raffaele.   == Research == In addition to neurotrophic keratitis, cenegermin is also under development for the treatment of dry eyes, retinitis pigmentosa, and glaucoma.   == References ==   == Further reading == Sheha H, Tighe S, Hashem O, Hayashida Y (October 2019). \"Update On Cenegermin Eye Drops In The Treatment Of Neurotrophic Keratitis\".
