{"name": "orciprenaline", "category": "drug", "content": "Orciprenaline, also known as metaproterenol, is a bronchodilator used in the treatment of asthma. Orciprenaline is a moderately selective \u03b22 adrenergic receptor agonist that stimulates receptors of the smooth muscle in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscle, with minimal or no effect on \u03b1 adrenergic receptors. The pharmacologic effects of \u03b2 adrenergic agonist drugs, such as orciprenaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through \u03b2 adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from many cells, especially from mast cells.   == Possible side effects == tremor nervousness dizziness weakness headache nausea tachycardia Rare side effects that could be life-threatening increased difficulty breathing rapid or increased heart rate irregular heartbeat chest pain or discomfort   == Brand names == Alupent Metaprel Orcibest   == References =="}
