It acts by covalently bonding to a cysteine residue near the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  In the US, it was given a breakthrough therapy designation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in December 2015, and In South Korea, the drug was approved in May 2016 for the second-line treatment of NSCLC with the T790M mutation of EGFR.  Resistance to olmutinib has been reported; a person's cancer started progressing after they developed a C797S mutation in EGFR. Olmutinib was discovered by Hanmi Pharmaceutical and licensed to Boehringer Ingelheim in 2015 in an agreement with a $50 million up front payment and up $680 million in milestones.   In November 2015 Hanmi granted an exclusive license to sell olmutinib in China to the Chinese company ZAI Labs.
