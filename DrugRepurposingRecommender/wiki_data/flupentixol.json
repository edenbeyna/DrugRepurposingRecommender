{"name": "flupentixol", "category": "drug", "content": "Flupentixol (INN), also known as flupenthixol (former BAN), marketed under brand names such as Depixol and Fluanxol is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced in 1965 by Lundbeck. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as flupentixol/melitracen\u2014a combination product containing both melitracen (a tricyclic antidepressant) and flupentixol (marketed as Deanxit). Flupentixol is  not approved for use in the United States. It is, however, approved for use in the UK, Australia, Canada, Russian Federation, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines, Iran, Germany, and various other countries.   == Medical uses == Flupentixol's main use is as a long-acting injection given once in every two or three weeks to individuals with schizophrenia who have poor compliance with medication and have frequent relapses of illness, though it is also commonly given as a tablet. There is little formal evidence to support its use for this indication but it has been in use for over fifty years. Flupentixol is also used in low doses as an antidepressant. There is tentative evidence that it reduces the rate of deliberate self-harm, among those who self-harm repeatedly.   == Adverse effects == Adverse effect incidence  Common (>1% incidence) adverse effects include  Extrapyramidal side effects such as: (which usually become apparent soon after therapy is begun or soon after an increase in dose is made) Muscle rigidity Hypokinesia Hyperkinesia Parkinsonism Tremor Akathisia Dystonia Dry mouth Constipation Hypersalivation \u2013 excessive salivation Blurred vision Diaphoresis \u2013 excessive sweating Nausea Dizziness Somnolence Restlessness Insomnia Overactivity Headache Nervousness Fatigue Myalgia Hyperprolactinemia and its complications such as: (acutely) Sexual dysfunction Amenorrhea \u2013 cessation of menstrual cycles Gynecomastia \u2013 enlargement of breast tissue in males Galactorrhea \u2013 the expulsion of breast milk that's not related to breastfeeding or pregnancy and if the hyperprolactinemia persists chronically, the following adverse effects may be seen: Reduced bone mineral density leading to osteoporosis (brittle bones) Infertility Dyspepsia \u2013 indigestion Abdominal pain Flatulence Nasal congestion Polyuria \u2013 passing more urine than usual Uncommon (0.1\u20131% incidence) adverse effects include  Fainting Palpitations Rare (<0.1% incidence) adverse effects include  Blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in the cell composition of blood), such as: Agranulocytosis \u2013 a drop in white blood cell counts that leaves one open to potentially life-threatening infections Neutropenia \u2013 a drop in the number of neutrophils (white blood cells that specifically fight bacteria) in one's blood Leucopenia \u2013 a less severe drop in white blood cell counts than agranulocytosis Thrombocytopenia \u2013 a drop in the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are responsible for blood clotting and hence this leads to an increased risk of bruising and other bleeds Neuroleptic malignant syndrome \u2013 a potentially fatal condition that appear to result from central D2 receptor blockade. The symptoms include: Hyperthermia Muscle rigidity Rhabdomyolysis Autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, diarrhea, diaphoresis, etc.) Mental status changes (e.g., coma, agitation, anxiety, confusion, etc.) Unknown incidence adverse effects include  Jaundice Abnormal liver function test results Tardive dyskinesia \u2013 an often incurable movement disorder that usually results from years of continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs, especially typical antipsychotics like flupenthixol. It presents with repetitive, involuntary, purposeless and slow movements; TD can be triggered by a fast dose reduction in any antipsychotic. Hypotension Confusional state Seizures Mania Hypomania Depression Hot flush Anergia Appetite changes Weight changes Hyperglycemia \u2013 high blood glucose (sugar) levels Abnormal glucose tolerance Pruritus \u2013 itchiness Rash Dermatitis Photosensitivity \u2013 sensitivity to light Oculogyric crisis Accommodation disorder Sleep disorder Impaired concentration Tachycardia QTc interval prolongation \u2013 an abnormality in the electrical activity of the heart that can lead to potentially fatal changes in heart rhythm (only in overdose or <10 ms increases in QTc) Torsades de pointes Miosis \u2013 constriction of the pupil of the eye Paralytic ileus \u2013 paralysis of the bowel muscles leading to severe constipation, inability to pass wind, etc. Mydriasis Glaucoma   === Interactions === It should not be used concomitantly with medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., 5-HT3 antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, citalopram, etc.) as this may lead to an increased risk of QTc interval prolongation. Neither should it be given concurrently with lithium (medication) as it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It should not be given concurrently with other antipsychotics due to the potential for this to increase the risk of side effects, especially neurological side effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It should be avoided in patients on CNS depressants such as opioids, alcohol and barbiturates.   === Contraindications === It should not be given in the following disease states:  Pheochromocytoma Prolactin-dependent tumors such as pituitary prolactinomas and breast cancer Long QT syndrome Coma Circulatory collapse Subcortical brain damage Blood dyscrasia Parkinson's disease Dementia with Lewy bodies   == Pharmacology ==   === Pharmacodynamics === Binding profile  Acronyms used: HFC \u2013 Human frontal cortex receptor MB \u2013 Mouse brain receptor RC \u2013 Cloned rat receptor A study measuring the in vivo receptor occupancies of 13 schizophrenic patients treated with 5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 mg/day of flupentixol found 50-70% receptor occupancy for D2, 20\u2009\u00b1\u20095% for D1, and 20\u2009\u00b1\u200910% for 5-HT2A. Its antipsychotic effects are predominantly a function of D2 antagonism. Its antidepressant effects at lower doses are not well understood; however, it may be mediated by functional selectivity and/or preferentially binding to D2 autoreceptors at low doses, resulting in increased postsynaptic activation via higher dopamine levels. Flupentixol's demonstrated ability to raise dopamine levels in mice and flies lends credibility to the supposition of autoreceptor bias. Functional selectivity may be responsible through causing preferential autoreceptor binding or other means. The effective dosage guideline for an antipsychotic is very closely related to its receptor residency time (i.e., where drugs like aripiprazole take several minutes or more to disassociate from a receptor while drugs like quetiapine and clozapine\u2014with guideline dosages in the hundreds of milligrams\u2014take under 30s) and long receptor residency time is strongly correlated with likehood of pronounced functional selectivity; thus, with a maximum guideline dose of only 18 mg/day for schizophrenia, there is a significant possibility of this drug possessing unique signalling characteristics that permit counterintuitive dopaminergic action at low doses.   === Pharmacokinetics ===   == History == In March 1963 the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck began research into further agents for schizophrenia, having already developed the thioxanthene derivatives clopenthixol and chlorprothixene. By 1965 the promising agent flupenthixol had been developed and trialled in two hospitals in Vienna by Austrian psychiatrist Heinrich Gross. The long- acting decanoate preparation was synthesised in 1967 and introduced into hospital practice in Sweden in 1968, with a reduction in relapses among patients who were put on the depot.   == References =="}
