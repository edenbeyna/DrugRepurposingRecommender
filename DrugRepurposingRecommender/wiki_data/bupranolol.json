{"name": "bupranolol", "category": "drug", "content": "Bupranolol is a non-selective beta blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), but with strong membrane stabilizing activity. Its potency is similar to propranolol.   == Uses and dosage == Like other beta blockers, oral bupranolol can be used to treat hypertension and tachycardia. The initial dose is 50 mg two times a day. It can be increased to 100 mg four times a day. Bupranolol eye drops (0.05%-0.5%) are used against glaucoma.   == Pharmacology == Bupranolol is quickly and completely absorbed from the gut. Over 90% undergo first-pass metabolism. Bupranolol has a plasma half life of about two to four hours, with levels never reaching 1 \u03bcg/L in therapeutic doses. The main metabolite is carboxybupranolol, 4-chloro-3-[3-(1,1-dimethylethylamino)-2-hydroxy-propyloxy]benzoic acid \u2013 that is, the methyl group at the benzene ring is oxidized to a carboxyl group \u2013, of which 88% are eliminated renally within 24 hours.   == Adverse effects, contraindications, interactions == Adverse effects, contraindications and interactions are similar to other beta blockers.   == References ==   == Further reading =="}
